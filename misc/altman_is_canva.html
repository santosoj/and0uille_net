Dear Canva
        </p>
        <p>
I have learnt that Canva Pty Ltd are collaborating with Sam Altman on a large‑scale artificial intelligence project. This is old news to any Canva employee who attended one of several meetings where unmistakeable allusions amounting to said collaboration were made.
        </p>
        <p>
As part of this project, Canva are engaging in «work gamification». Work gamification here takes on the shape of bogus employee profiles being created. Actual Canva employees would then be contacted by one of these fake, AI‑generated profiles, and asked to work on a «bullshit» task. (Both «work gamification» and «bullshit job» have recently become terms which are used in scholarship around labour.)
        </p>
        <p>
Employees of Canva are exposed to this without prior notification. If someone were to be involved in such an experiment, they should be informed, and they should have given consent. Exposing employees to this practice without their explicit consent is unconscionable, and can result in emotional distress and other adverse effects for the employee and their next of kin.
        </p>
        <p>
I will from here on in not further communicate with Canva. Should Canva press charges on the grounds of a breach of confidentiality or suchlike, I am ready to repeat and affirm my statements in court. Numerous Canva employees and ex‑employees have had a similar experience and thus would be able to confirm my description of Canva's «work gamification» and «bullshit job» practice.
        </p>
        <p>
Kind regards
        </p>
        <p>
