Andouille is a digital media artist and software entomologist based in Naarm, Wurundjeri land, also known as Melbourne. Andouille's preferred pronoun is <i>they/them</i>, although they keep accepting <i>he/him</i> indefinitely. They currently identify as «man/nonbinary».

Andouille may be <em class="hyperemphasize">contacted</em> by sending an email to their trusted inbox «cyberand0uille [ :.at.: ] proton [ :.dot.: ] me». The ‘socials’ below should also work.

And now for the slightly longer elevator speech set in the first person…

I am a content creator and brand. Should you wish to get in touch for booking / collab, please do not hesitate, but please be mindful that we live in an age of stochastic parrots―also called «large language models» by some―where attribution is cheap. Through any of the available channels, please initiate a realtime conversation, so either party can verify that who they are dealing with is genuine.

See some of my recent work in the other sections. There's a photo of «<a href="studio.html">And0uille Studio</a>», if you'd like to see my very low‑tech setup.
        </p>
I am the label head of <a target="_blank" href="https://20kbps.net/index2.htm">20kbps</a>, one of the internet's oldest living netlabels, and birthplace of the genre named <i>lo‑bit</i>. I've done a complete <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/klubderkluebe/20kbps_pyramid">rewrite</a> of the netlabel's ‘engine’ after it was handed over to me by the previous owner. I've been active as a netlabel artist myself for about as long as 20kbps has existed.
        <p>
I'm a coder, not a very good one, but good enough not to be a bad one. Not too passionate about any technology in particular. Sometimes I enjoy doing impractical and weird things such as retrocoding or exploring internals of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Used to do quite a bit of binary analysis / <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/P9LHK6PB1UA">reverse code engineering</a> ages ago.
        </p>
        <p>
My languages are German, English, Indonesian, and French. I am Indonesian on my father's side, that's how I know the language and have my last name. I know a few things about 1965, have seen Joshua Oppenheimer's films, and have read Melvin, Roosa, and Bevins.
        </p>
        <p>
I have a <a aria-label="Bachelor's credentials, musicology major" target="_blank" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/20kbps-static/00_MISC/docs/bamus/ba_zeugnis.jpg">degree</a> in musicology from the University of Graz, Austria, and some <a aria-label="Evidence of academic achievement, mathematics major BSc" target="_blank" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/20kbps-static/00_MISC/docs/scheinehagen/scheine__5_pages.jpg">credit</a> towards a mathematics degree, so I actually know how to count, not all, but some things.
        </p>
        <p>
I want to preface this paragraph by saying that I know how the use of irony can be problematic on the internet, and therefore refrain from using irony. I actually am what is colloquially called a «leftie‑greenie». I am a democratic socialist who believes that some valid points of Marx's can be heeded without calling for the dictatorship of the proletariat. My social values generally align with those that are labelled «liberal» or «progressive», and this, of course, does <em>not</em> imply that I should support economic liberalism. With regard to AusPol specifically, I witness with consternation how governments both Coalition and Labor prioritize pleasing the US empire, when ideally, alliances should be with Southeast Asian states first and foremost.
        </p>
        <p>
People change, but some things have remained fairly constant through all the years. I'm still a fan of Todd Solondz's films, every one of them from <i>Fear, Anxiety & Depression</i> to <i>Wiener-Dog</i>, and I still count Werner Herzog and Stanley Kubrick among my greats. I still listen to old The Smiths and Morrissey songs occasionally, even though I think the man's political statements have been nothing short of deplorable. And I still don't wish to be invited to church, or to join a church, be that explicitly or implicitly.
