Sometimes Andouille writes. They are one of the legion who haven't written a book <em>«yet»</em>. The guillemets are emphasized for a reason. In all probability, Andouille shall never «do a book». B/c srsly who does that anymore. That kind of agent is likely to survive for another quarter‑century. A bit longer probably, given how <i>katholisch‑faschistisch</i>―as Thomas Bernhard would have called him―author Davila is <em>sometimes</em> right about the conservative <em>always</em> winning out. But not much<sup>1</sup>.
          </p>
          <p>
For old times' sake, and because we're having summit‑level fun here, let me further preface the below with these lines from <i>Catullus 16</i>, a fine poem that has lasted longer than―some other poems, and that, sadly, has been misinterpreted by some to be in defence of that ghastly «free speech absolutism» which has been endorsed of late by blood‑diamond heirs and the like<sup>2</sup>.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
nam castum esse decet pium poetam ipsum<br/>
versiculos nihil necesse est
          </blockquote>

I am doing as <a target="_blank" href="https://franziskaschutzbach.wordpress.com/mein-blog-prazis-und-kopflos/">Franziska Schutzbach</a>, whom I idolize, did, and publishing <i>Unausgegorenes</i> (perhaps «the forever callow»), <i>präzis und kopflos</i> (perhaps «rushing into the secret house with utmost precision»).<sup>2</sup>
          </p>
          <p><small>
<sup>1</sup>Davila's brittle credibility, then, is evidenced by the shape of his output, which in true catholic‑fascist contradiction‑happy fashion, is a connectome of fragments. Srsly tho, what's this guy's problem?
          </small></p>

<sup>2</sup>This is for you, Walter. Both of you. And for Bernfeld. «Who knows when we shall meet again. If ever.»
          </small></p>
          <p><small>
<sup>3</sup>And woe to the <em>man</em> who should ever as much as have the <em>hint</em> of a thought that he could train a stochastic parrot to write like I ache. This is for you, Emily. Both of you. And to falling in love much too easily. «Time. Beckoning me.»

As some know, the backstory of this is that one day I was walking through one of the halls of Box Hill Shopping Centre when one of Stroke Foundation's fundraising staff started talking to me. IIRC, and I believe that I do, Gráinne explicitly told me that she was with Crisis Group. But perhaps I'm just a crazy little man who can't tell actual from fabricated memory. As always, <em>not</em> being ironic there―I have «remembered» things quite often, and science knows now that memory is fabrication to much higher a degree than one should like to think.
          </p>
          <p>
Anyhoo. Gron‑ya is the reason. For…

            And ultimately for making Belfast one of the «legs» of my impending Europe tour. In fact, if all goes to plan, and I reckon it will, I shall spend <span class="inline-monospace">2024‑06‑19 … 2024‑06‑26</span> in Belfast.

          <h3>Empire</h3>

          <p>
A set of texts that I wrote in 2023. Topic is US foreign policy and the damage it caused in various locations and decades. My entrance into this topic was learning about «1965», i.e. the events in Indonesian history where hundreds of thousands were murdered on the allegation of being «communist» or «communist sympathizers», or simply because they were of Chinese ethnicity.
          </p>
          <p>
Indonesia 1965 is by far not the only set of events where bloodshed happened, and was welcomed by the US empire, and co‑engineered by makers of US foreign policy. It is the one closest to me though, because my father is Indonesian and of Chinese ethnicity. In 1998, anti‑Chinese violence flared up to such an extent that it was on the radar internationally. I was already at an age where I could consciously take note of this, and I remember hearing mentions of it, but not having context, I wasn't able to grasp what it meant, and of what nature my Indonesian relatives' feeling terrified was, until much later.
          </p>
          <p>
It is the brutality of US foreign policy felt immediately, and in many cases physically, by those who are at the suffering end of it, that I made the subject of my January 2024 music‑and‑animated‑gif piece «<a target="_blank" href="https://and0uille.net/decadesofliberation/">decades of liberation</a>».
